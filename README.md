Senal UI is a UI library that is designed for the ecosystem of FOIL, Smith-Pad, and Electric-E.
as well as for you too.


Originally before it is called FOIL-UI that is only for CSS, but now, it is called senalUI with 
the goal to provide the same UI style scheme for everything basically, that's the goal I have 
in mind. But FOIL-UI is still there, but slowly over time, it will slow down, in a sense.


The another goal here is to make developers and creators easy to use with reusable templates for 
many different platforms and variants.
